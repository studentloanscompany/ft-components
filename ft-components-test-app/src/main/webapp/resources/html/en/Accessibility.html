<h3>Navigation aids</h3>

<p>The home page and all subsequent pages include search functionality to search the sites content.</p>
 
<p>The pages in the site follow a natural tab order.  Where this is not the case, the tab order has been set in the code to force a user down the correct logical order of the page.</p>


<h3>Links</h3>

<p>There are no JavaScript pseudo-links.  All links can be followed in any browser, even if scripting is turned off. There are no links that open new windows without warning.</p>


<h3>Images</h3>

<p>All content images used on the site have descriptive ALT attributes.</p>
 
<p>The site makes extensive use of Cascading Style Sheets and most images are in the 'background' of the page and not registered by screen readers. This is worth noting when using the 'disable image' feature of some browsers.</p>


<h3>Standards compliance</h3>

<p>This website endeavours to conform to WCAG 2  AA from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.</p>
 
<p>Whilst we strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. The secure areas of the site cannot be accessed through the Opera Browser and other browsers that share its User Agent (such as the text browser Lynx).</p>
